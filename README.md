CompBayesCaseStudy
==================

Our case study for a class at Olin College called Computational Bayesian Statistics

The file Lidar.py is our Bayesian implementation of a method for using noisy range finder sensor data to find position of objects.

thinkbayes contains code written by Allen Downey that provide a framework for implementing Bayesian solutions to problems in python. The full repository can be found here https://github.com/AllenDowney/ThinkBayes2

Our arduino code can be found in the folder taking_measurements, and the files we used to find dunctions for sensor data are in the folder calibration. 

This repository also contains out writeup of the project.
